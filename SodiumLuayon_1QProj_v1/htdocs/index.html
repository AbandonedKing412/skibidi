        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            The environment is facing serious challenges such as climate change, pollution, and deforestation, 
            all of which threaten millions, if not billions, worldwide. In the Philippines alone, 
            over 2.7 million tons of plastic waste are generated annually, 
            much of it polluting rivers and oceans. 47% of the nation's forests have already been lost due to logging, 
            urbanization, and agricultural expansion. 
            These issues highlight how human activities continue to place immense strain on natural resources.
        </p>
        <p>
            Forest loss increases the risks of flooding and landslides, while polluted surroundings 
            expose communities to disease. These problems not only harm people directly but also weaken the balance of 
            ecosystems that we all depend on. 
            Still, it is not too late to change the way we live. By choosing a sustainable lifestyle and practicing small, consistent actions, 
            each of us can make a lasting difference for the planet and future generations.

        <h2>What is Being Done About It in the Philippines?</h2>
        <p>
            Different organizations and the government are taking steps to address environmental problems. 
            The Ecological Solid Waste Management Act promotes segregation and proper waste disposal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Republic Act 11038 conserves biodiversity by protecting ecologically important lands and waters, and these laws 
            serve as the foundation for national environmental protection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not only that, but advocacy groups such as EcoWaste Coalition, Greenpeace Philippines, and local community initiatives, 
            including Eco Ways, continue to push for clean ups, recycling drives, tree planting, and awareness campaigns. 
            These combined efforts show that protecting the environment requires not only government action but also active participation 
            from communities and individuals.

        <h2>Purpose of Our Page</h2>
        <p>
            Through this website, I aim to inform and inspire people to take simple actions that can 
            help protect the environment, conserve resources, and reduce pollution. We also organize seminars 
            and community discussions to share knowledge, promote sustainable practices, and encourage more people to actively participate in environmental protection.
